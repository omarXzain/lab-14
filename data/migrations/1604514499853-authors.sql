She HATES the gym) and is whisked off to the hospital where she discovers the honeymoon is truly overâ€”she''s getting divorced, she has three kids, and she''s actually 39 years old. Alice must reconstruct the events of a lost decade, and find out whether it''s possible to reconstruct her life at the same time.

Ultimately, Alice must discover whether forgetting is a blessing or a curse, and whether it''s possible to start over...'
